# Colab and Python Notebooks


- What are Python notebooks? 
    - They are a complete narrative of code and comments that can render many HTML components, such as images, hyperlinks, videos, etc. Therefore, the goal of a notebook is to demonstrate some code or explain some idea in the most engaging way possible.
- What is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)? (click on the link to review)
    - It is a Python notebook that runs on the cloud so you don't need to install anything on your PC. It runs on the browser.
    - Difference between Code and Text/Markdown: A Python notebook contains two types of cells. Today we will deal with the text/markdown part.
- Shortcuts for entering code and markdown mode in Colab.
    - Convert cell to code cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M Y`
    - Convert cell to text/markdown cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M M`
- Introduction to [markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)
    - Headings, bullets, hyperlinks, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc
    - Tables
    - Latex equations in markdown
- Images, videos
- How to [load](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) in Colab an ipynb from Github
- Autocomplete in Google Colab for code] [optional]
    - When you write Python code in Colab it helps you "autocomplete" the review. Review this [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb#scrollTo=d4L9TOP9QSHn)
